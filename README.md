Implementation of MCTS (Monte Carlo Tree Search) for various games.

Languages:

* Python
* Typescript (only tic tac toe so far)

Games:

* tic tac toe
* nim
* a simple dice game
* a simple battle game

AIs:

* random
* MCTS

More complete typescript implementations, more (or more profound)
games, more AIs (Alpha Zero-like ML on top of MCTS) might be coming in
the future.

A major motivation for this is to try out typing in Python/Javascript.
